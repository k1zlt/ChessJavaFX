# Simple Chess game on javafx

The Simple Chess game on javafx is an interactive application that allows players to enjoy the classic game
of chess on their computer screens. The game follows the most of the standard rules of chess, where two 
players take turns moving their pieces on an 8x8 chessboard.

The graphical user interface (GUI) is built using JavaFX, providing an intuitive and visually appealing 
interface. The chessboard is displayed with alternating light and green squares, creating a realistic 
playing environment. Each chess piece is represented by its corresponding icon, making it easy for players 
to identify and move the pieces.

To play the game, players can click on a piece to select it, and then click on a valid square to move 
the piece. The application enforces the rules of chess, preventing most of the illegal moves such as moving 
a piece through other pieces or making a move that captures a piece of the same color.

The game also includes basic features such as highlighting valid moves when a piece is selected.

The JavaFX Chess Game provides an enjoyable and interactive experience for chess enthusiasts of all skill 
levels. It offers a convenient way to play chess on a computer, with an intuitive interface and a 
visually appealing design. Whether you're a beginner learning the game or an experienced player looking 
for a digital chessboard, this application offers a fun and engaging chess experience.
